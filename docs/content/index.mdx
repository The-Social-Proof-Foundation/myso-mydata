MyData is a decentralized secrets management (DSM) service that relies on access control policies defined and validated on [MySo](https://docs.mysocial.network/concepts/components). Application developers and users can use MyData to secure sensitive data at rest on decentralized storage like [Walrus](https://docs.wal.app/), or on any other on-chain or off-chain storage.

## Features

- **Encryption and decryption:** MyData supports encryption of sensitive data using a [secret sharing mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing), where one can encrypt sensitive data using different public keys and store those on Walrus or another storage. When needed, one can decrypt the encrypted parts using private keys generated by off-chain key servers (see the following section). To maximize privacy, MyData uses client-side encryption where the application or user is responsible to encrypt and decrypt the data.
- **Access control on MySo:** MyData leverages [MySo](https://docs.mysocial.network/concepts/components) for controlling access to the decryption keys, and thus allows access control for the sensitive data itself. A user can achieve this by implementing an application-specific Move package that must follow some MyData conventions. The application-specific logic in the Move package controls when to allow or disallow access to a key, and this flexibility provides a way to realize various authorization scenarios. Refer to [MyData design](/Design) and [Using MyData](UsingMyData) for details.
- **Decentralized gatekeeping using off-chain servers:** MyData key server is a simple and lightweight service that is queried by an application or user to validate the access control on MySo and to generate an identity-based private key that can be further used to decrypt the encrypted data. Different parties can operate their own MyData key servers, thus allowing users to realize `t-out-of-n` threshold encryption. In such a scenario, `n` is the number of total MyData key servers, and `t` is the threshold number of key servers that a user chooses for their use case. MyData does not require any specific key server to be used, and applications or users can choose their preferred key servers based on their trust assumptions or regulatory requirements. Refer to [MyData design](/Design) and [Using MyData](UsingMyData) for details.
- **Seamless access:** Applications can interact with MyData key servers using software development kits (SDKs). The [TypeScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@socialproof/mydata) is available through npm.

## Use cases

There are a number of Web3 use cases that could utilize MyData to secure sensitive data in a safe and scalable manner. Some of those are:

- Secure personal data on [Walrus](https://docs.wal.app/) or some other storage, such that it's only accessible by the user who uploaded it.
- Share secure content stored on [Walrus](https://docs.wal.app/) or some other storage with a specific allowlist of users.
- Share gated content on a content subscription application with a verified list of subscribers.
- Realize end-to-end private messages using MySo and Walrus.
- Implement secure voting and MEV-resilient trading in Move.
- And more.

Check out the [Getting Started Guide](/GettingStarted).

## Potential future capabilities

The MyData team is looking for community feedback on what other capabilities would make sense to add to MyData. Some options are:

- Realize a MyData key server with a multi-party computation (MPC) committee.
- Support server-side encryption to allow decryption of the secret data by MyData key servers, as an alternative to, or an extension of, client-side encryption.
- Digital Rights Management (DRM) to allow encryption and decryption on the client side in a secure and trusted environment, similar to how popular streaming services like Netflix, YouTube, and HBO use DRM technology.

## Non-goals

Even though MyData is supposed to be a generic and flexible secret management service for a variety of use cases, the following are not its supposed goals. Do not use MyData for such use cases and instead look for a more relevant product or service.

- MyData is not a key management service like [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) or any other such Web2 service, in the sense that MyData backends do not store any application- or user-specific keys. A MyData key server only stores its specific master key pair, where the master public key is used by users to encrypt sensitive data, and the master private key is used to derive identity-based keys to decrypt the data.
- MyData is not a privacy-preserving technology like [zkLogin](https://docs.mysocial.network/concepts/cryptography/zklogin). Instead, MyData is supposed to be a collection of components allowing application developers and users to secure sensitive data on-chain or off-chain by using the security properties of threshold encryption, MySo, and Move.
- MyData should not be used to store highly sensitive data like a user's wallet keys, or regulated personal data like PHI (personal health information), or any local, state, or federal government-level secret data, or other data of similar sensitivity. Some advanced capabilities might be added to MyData in the future to allow using it for some of such use cases, but those do not exist yet.

## Upgrade policy

MyData strives to maintain backward compatibility. Any breaking changes to the Key Server API or the TypeScript SDK will be communicated in advance on both GitHub and in the MyData Discord channel.

The MyData team will provide a clear migration path for existing users to upgrade to new versions. New versions of the Key Server will be published under [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MystenLabs/mydata/releases) and tagged with the appropriate version number.

Both the SDK and the Key Server are configured to expect specific versions from each other. Either component can reject messages from outdated or deprecated counterparties.
