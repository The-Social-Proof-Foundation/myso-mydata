This guide is meant to help you quickly bootstrap with MyData. Before deploying your app to production or Mainnet, review the full MyData documentation to understand the design, security best practices, and operational requirements.

## Bootstrap your app

MyData makes it simple to add decentralized encryption and programmable access control to your Web3 applications. Follow these steps to get started:

**1. Install the MyData SDK**

MyData provides a TypeScript SDK for easy integration. Install it from npm:
```shell
npm install @socialproof/mydata
```

Reference: [SDK on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@socialproof/mydata)

**2. Choose key servers in Testnet**

MyData relies on a committee of key servers to generate threshold-based decryption keys.

- Use [verified key servers](/Pricing#verified-key-servers) for Testnet.
- For permissioned servers, contact the provider to allowlist your access policy package ID (see the following section).

**3. Define your access policy**

Access policies are written as Move modules on MySo. Examples include:

- Token-gated access
- Subscription-based access
- Time-locked decryption
- Allowlist-based access

See [Example patterns](/ExamplePatterns) to help you get started.

**4. Encrypt your data**

Use the SDK to encrypt data before storing it:
```typescript
const { encryptedObject: encryptedBytes, key: backupKey } = await client.encrypt({
    threshold: 2,
    packageId: fromHEX(packageId),
    id: fromHEX(id),
    data,
});
```

Learn more in the [Encryption Guide](/UsingMyData#encryption).

**5. Store encrypted data**

Store your encrypted content in Walrus (using the [HTTP API](https://docs.wal.app/usage/web-api.html) or [one of the SDKs](https://docs.wal.app/usage/sdks.html)), MySo (as [Objects](https://docs.mysocial.network/concepts/object-model)), or any storage of your choice.

**6. Decrypt data with access control**

When a user requests access, MyData checks your on-chain policy. If approved, decryption keys are provided to meet the threshold.
```typescript
// Create the Transaction for evaluating the mydata_approve function.
const tx = new Transaction();
tx.moveCall({
    target: `${packageId}::${moduleName}::mydata_approve`, 
    arguments: [
        tx.pure.vector("u8", fromHEX(id)),
        // other arguments
   ]
 });  
const txBytes = tx.build( { client: mysoClient, onlyTransactionKind: true })
const decryptedBytes = await client.decrypt({
    data: encryptedBytes,
    sessionKey,
    txBytes,
});
```

Learn more in the [Decryption Guide](/UsingMyData#decryption).

## Next steps

- Read the [MyData Design](/Design) documentation for a deeper understanding of how MyData works.
- Explore example apps in the [Examples Directory](https://github.com/MystenLabs/mydata/tree/main/examples).
- Review the [Security Best Practices](/SecurityBestPractices) to ensure you're following recommended guidelines.
- Refer to the [Performance Recommendations](/UsingMyData#optimizing-performance) before deploying your app to Mainnet.
- When deploying to Mainnet, decide whether to run your own key server as part of your threshold committee.
    - If you operate a secure, hardened full node and have the necessary DevOps expertise and bandwidth, you can choose to self-run a key server. See the [Key Server Operations Guide](/KeyServerOps).
