# MyData pricing

- **Choose your own key server providers:** MyData supports a decentralized network of independent key servers. Builders can select any combination of providers to form their preferred threshold configuration for encryption and decryption.
- **Transparent pricing and features:** Each key server provider sets their own pricing and rate limits based on their service model. Builders can evaluate and choose based on what best fits their application needs.
- **Curated discoverability:** This documentation lists a verified set of providers along with available links to their configuration details, terms, and pricing, so you can integrate with confidence.

## Verified key servers

Refer to [Key Server Operations](/KeyServerOps) for detailed information on `Open` and `Permissioned` modes of key servers. At a high level:

- A key server in `Open` mode lets anyone request keys for any access policy package, using a shared master key. It is ideal for public or trial use.
- A key server in `Permissioned` mode restricts access to approved access policy packages per client, each with a dedicated master key, and supports secure key server rotation or switching when needed. It is designed for dedicated or commercial use.

### Testnet

- Mysten Labs: The following key servers are configured using the `Open` mode and freely available for experimentation, development, and testing. A source-based rate limit is configured which cannot be changed for any client.

:::note

Testnet key servers are provided for developer testing only and do not come with availability guarantees, SLAs, or assurances regarding long-term key persistence. Avoid using them to encrypt data you expect to access reliably in the future.

:::note

The URL for any listed key server can change over time. What matters is the Object ID, which points to the on-chain key server object. That object always holds the latest URL as the source of truth.
