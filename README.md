[MyData](https://mydata.mystenlabs.com/) is a decentralized secrets management (DSM) product. Application developers and users can use MyData to secure sensitive data at rest on decentralized storage like [Walrus](https://docs.wal.app/) or any other onchain / offchain storage. MyData enables identity-based encryption and decryption of sensitive data, with access controlled by onchain policies on MySo. Lightweight key servers enforce these policies and provide threshold-based decryption keys, while developers can integrate easily using the [TypeScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@socialproof/mydata).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Refer to the MyData documentation at [mydata-docs.wal.app](https://mydata-docs.wal.app) for a deeper product overview and details on the design, developer and key server usage, available key servers, security best practices, and terms of service. As a backup, you can also find the same content in the [docs directory](./docs/).
